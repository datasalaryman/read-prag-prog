## The essence of good design

The ETC principle - easy to change

*Good design is easier to change than bad design*

## DRY - The evils of duplication

*Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system*

- Level 1 DRY - Don't copy and paste lines of code. 
- Level 2 DRY - Use self-explanatory names
- Level 3 DRY - Isolate one idea to one part in the data structure
- Level 4 DRY - Create systems that are single sources of truth
- Level 5 DRY - Communicate all knowledge across your team

## Orthogonality

*In a well-designed system, changes to individual components generally do not effects on other components*

## Reversibility

## Tracer bullets

## Prototypes and Post-it notes

## Domain languages

## Estimating
