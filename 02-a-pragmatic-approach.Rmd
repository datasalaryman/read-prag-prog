# Chapter 2. A pragmatic approach

## The essence of good design

The ETC principle - easy to change

*Good design is easier to change than bad design*

## DRY - The evils of duplication

*Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system*

- Level 1 DRY - Don't copy and paste lines of code. 
- Level 2 DRY - Use self-explanatory names
- Level 3 DRY - Isolate one idea to one part in the data structure
- Level 4 DRY - Create systems that are single sources of truth
- Level 5 DRY - Communicate all knowledge across your team

## Orthogonality

*In a well-designed system, changes to individual components generally do not effects on other components*

> You want to design components that are self-contained: independent, and with a single, well-defined purpose ...

Other words for orthogonality:
- modular
- component-based
- layered

### Toolkits and libraries

> When you bring in a toolkit (or even a library from other members of your team), ask yourself whether it imposes changes on your code that shouldn't be there. 

-->

## Reversibility

> The mistake lies in assuming that any decision is cast in stoneâ€”and in not preparing for the contingencies that might arise. Instead if carving decisions in stone, think of them more as being written in the sand at the beach. A big wave can come and wipe them out at any time.
